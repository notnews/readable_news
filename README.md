# Readable News: Readability of News Over Time

Has the news become more readable over time? We use the [NYT Corpus](https://github.com/notnews/nytimes-corpus-extractor) and the [Top 10! News Corpus](https://github.com/notnews/top10) to assess how the complexity of news articles has evolved over time. 

We use the [Python package textstat](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/) to estimate where each article lies on the Flesch Reading Ease scale, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale, The Fog Scale, and the SMOG scale, along with the number of words, and such.
